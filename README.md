## Covid-19 EDA 

### Description
The goal of this mini project was to perform simple exploratory data analysis on covid-19 data from Feb 2020 to Aug 2022 using T-SQL. Several SQL concepts were applied to get insights from the data such as CTEs, table joins, views, and more. Any suggestions regarding add-ons or modifications to the project are **highly appreciated**!
